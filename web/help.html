        <h2 id="software">Recording Software</h2>

        <h3>Windows</h3>

        <p>If you have a Windows computer, you likely already have the
          <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17444/windows-camera-app-webcams-help">
            Camera</a> app, which can be used to record video. Any videos you
          create in the app will be saved under <code>Pictures/Camera Roll</code>.</p>

        <h3>Mac</h3>

        <p>Macs come with two good options for recording video:
          <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/photo-booth/take-a-photo-or-record-a-video-pbhlp3714a9d/10.0/mac/10.14">
            Photo Booth</a> and
          <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201066#record">QuickTime</a>.</p>

        <h3>Zoom</h3>

        <p>If you have <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>, you can also use it
          to record a video of just yourself. It takes a little more work than
          the other options listed on this page, but produces good results. You
          will need a (free) zoom account in order to record.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Open Zoom and sign in if you are not already signed in.</li>
          <li><strong>Important:</strong> make sure to
            <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115003279466-Enabling-option-to-preserve-original-sound#h_7845b217-db22-44f5-9163-7978496d953f">
              change the default audio settings</a>, which are designed for
            clear audio during video conferencing, but will make a singing
            recording sound strange.
            <ul>
              <li>Open Zoom's settings and select <code>Audio</code>.</li>
              <li>Click <code>Advanced</code>.</li>
              <li>Then check the box labled <code>Show in-meeting option to
                  "Enable Original Sound" from microphone</code>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Now, start a new meeting. You won't invite anyone else to join
            this meeting, but you can only record in Zoom when you're in a
            meeting.</li>
          <li>You should see an option in the top left of your screen to
            <code>Turn on Original Sound</code>, which you enabled in step 2.
            Click that button. If the button says <code>Turn off Original
              Sound</code> instead, you don't need to change anything.</li>
          <li>Finally, turn on your video and audio and click the
            <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording#h_2b0b123c-d9e9-48bc-b0c6-3cd874ebc98a">
              <code>Record</code></a> button on the bottom of your screen.</li>
          <li>When you are done recording, either click
            <code>End Meeting</code> (in the bottom right), or click
            <code>Stop Recording</code>, and then end the meeting. If you have
            successfully created a recording, you should see a window that says
            it is converting and saving the recording. You should see an
            <code>.mp4</code> file with a video recording, and an
            <code>.m4a</code> file with just the audio.</li>
